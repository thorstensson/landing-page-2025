# Landing Page For Folio Coming Oct 12th 2025

Landing page. New folio launch date is set to **Oct 12th 2025**. Note that my folio is coming at **thomasthorstensson (dot) com** and **thomasjt (dot) com** will at that point turn into an alias repointing to this my new Netlify domain.

- [X] Updated CSS for most wrappers.

- [X] Made the ThreeJS scene full screen and fixed responsive resize issue.
