# Landing Page Nuxt

Nuxt landing page for my new netlify domain, [thomasjt.com](https://www.thomasjt.com). The previous landing page, also here on my GitHub, needed a remake. No contact form on this one.

Back to my portfolio work. I will be back :penguin:

## Fixed

- [X] Changed the text scroller into a GSAP text scroller, see this [GSAP community post](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/42921-horizontal-infinite-text-loop-without-empty-spaces/)

- [X] Updated CSS for most wrappers.

- [X] Made the ThreeJS scene full screen and fixed responsive resize issue.

- [X] Added apple style toggle switch for audio, using v-model, credits to the original CSS solution here https://dev.to/urielbitton/how-to-design-an-ios-style-switch-4maj - which I've now adpoted into Vue.
